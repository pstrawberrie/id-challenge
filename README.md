# Code Challenge for Infield Digital

### Environment
- Node + Gulp + Browsersync
- SCSS + Autoprefixer

##### Explanation

I chose to use gulp and browsersync because I wanted to see how quickly I could set it up and get everything running smooth. I ran into an issue with vscode sporadically throwing errors when trying to compile scss, however did not want to waste any time debugging it. The styles will still compile properly, it just may take an extra save.
